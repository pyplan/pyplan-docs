# **App Home**
After logging in, the user lands at the app homepage, which is a starting point for:

 - Creating a new app or Opening recent models 
 - Recovering any opened session 
 - Opening tutorials or examples
 - Launching a tool (left-hand menu where options are enabled or not depending on whether there is an open model)

Users can go back to the homepage any time by clicking at the Pyplan icon or selecting Summary from the dropdown menu in the app header.
